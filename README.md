## 🔐 Authentication

The application uses a simple localStorage-based authentication system for development purposes:

- **Email-based login**: Users sign in with any email address
- **Session persistence**: User sessions are saved in browser localStorage
- **Automatic redirection**: Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page
- **Route protection**: All routes except `/login` require authentication

**Note**: This authentication system is suitable for development and portfolio demonstration only. For production use, implement proper backend authentication with secure tokens and password hashing.
